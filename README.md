# 💀 Set Up

Clone this repository from your GitHub account with the `use template` button

### 1) Sanity
1. `npm install -g @sanity/cli` to install Sanity globally
2. `npm install && sanity init` in the `/studio` folder
3. During Sanity's initalization it will warn you, type `Y` and hit `enter`:
```
? The current folder contains a configured Sanity studio. Would you like to reconfigure it? (Y/n)
```
4. When it asks you what dataset configuration to use, go with the `default`
5. Add CORS Origins to your newly created Sanity project (visit: [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io) and go to Settings > API):
    - Add your Studio URLs **_with_** credentials: `http://localhost:3333` and `[subdomain].sanity.studio`
    - Add your front-end URLs **_without_** credentials: `http://localhost:3000` and `https://[subdomain].vercel.app`
> ⚠️ **Note** <br />This Studio uses the new "actions" resolver to handle "singleton" documents. To adjust what documents should behave like singletons be sure to edit the `singletons` array in the following file: `/studio/parts/resolve-actions.js`
    
### 2) Shopify Storefront Access
1. Enable Private Apps in Shopify
   - Apps > "Manage Private Apps" *(text link in page footer)*
   - Enable Private Apps
2. Create new Private App
   - Apps > Manage Private Apps > "Create private app" 
   - Give this a relevant name, I prefer: "Headless Storefront", so it's clear what it's being used for
   - Use your dev email to know when there are issues
   - Change Admin API permissions on "Products" to `Read and write`
   - Allow this app to access your storefront data using the Storefront API, with at least the following permissions:
      - Read inventory of products and their variants
      - Read and modify checkouts

### 3) Shopify Webhooks
1. Go to "Settings" *(bottom left)* -> "Notifications" -> "Webhooks" *(very bottom)*
2. add the following webhooks:
  - product update - `[your-domain]/api/shopify/product-update`
  - product deletion - `[your-domain]/api/shopify/product-delete`
> ⚠️ **Note** <br />You have to use a real domain name (no localhost). Be sure to use your Vercel project URL during development, and then switch to the production domain once live. You won't know your Vercel project domain until you deploy in a later step, just enter in what you think it will be for now!

### 4) NextJS
1. `npm install` in the project root folder on local
2. Create an `.env.local` file in the project folder, and add the following variables:
```
SANITY_PROJECT_DATASET=production
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=XXXXXX
SANITY_API_TOKEN=XXXXXX
SHOPIFY_STORE_ID=XXXXXX
SHOPIFY_API_TOKEN=XXXXXX
SHOPIFY_API_PASSWORD=XXXXXX
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_INTEGRITY=XXXXXX

// Needed for Klaviyo forms:
KLAVIYO_API_KEY=XXXXXX

// Needed for Mailchimp forms:
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=XXXXXX-usX
MAILCHIMP_SERVER=usX

// Needed for SendGrid forms:
SENDGRID_API_KEY=XXXXXX
```
3. Update all the `XXXXXX` values, here's where to find each:
  - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` - You can grab this after you've initalized Sanity, either from the `studio/sanity.json` file, or from your Sanity Manage dashboard
  - `SANITY_API_TOKEN` - Generate an API token for your Sanity project. Access your project from the Sanity Manage dashboard, and navigate to: "Settings" -> "API" -> "Add New Token" button. Make sure you give `read + write` access!
  - `SHOPIFY_STORE_ID` - This is your Shopify store ID, it's the subdomain behind `.myshopify.com`
  - `SHOPIFY_API_TOKEN` - Copy the Storefront Access Token you copied from setting up your Private Shopify App. _(Note: This is **not** the Admin API Key, scroll to the bottom where it says "Storefront API" for the correct value)_
  - `SHOPIFY_API_PASSWORD` - Copy the Admin API password from "Apps" -> "Manage private apps" -> [your_private_app].
  - `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_INTEGRITY` - Copy the Integrity hash from "Settings" -> "Notifications" -> "Webhooks" *(very bottom of page)*
  - `KLAVIYO_API_KEY` - This is your Public API Key / Site ID from your Klaviyo Account "Settings" -> "API Keys"
  - `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY` - Create an API key from "Account -> "Extras" -> API Keys
  - `MAILCHIMP_SERVER` - This is the server your account is from. It's in the URL when logged in and at the end of your API Key
  - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Create an API key from "Settings" -> "API Keys" with "Restricted Access" to only "Mail Send"
  
### 5) Shopify Store Theme
Since we're serving our store through a headless environment, we don't want visitors accessing our unused shopify theme. The domain for this is visible during checkout, and is publicly accessible. To silence it, replace your current theme's `theme.liquid` file with the one from this repo, and replace `your_frontsite_domain` with your actual frontsite domain URL **(do not include protocol or trailing slash)**

This will essentially "pass-through" URLs accessed at your Shopify Store to your true headless storefront *(ie. `shop.666.com/products` -> `666.com/products`)*

<br />

# ⚡ Spin Up

### Next (Front End)
`npm run dev` in the project folder to start the front end locally
   - Your front end should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   
### Sanity (Back End)
`sanity start` in the `/studio` folder to start the studio locally
   - Your Sanity Studio should be running on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

<br />

# 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel
This is setup to work seamlessly with Vercel, which I highly recommend as your hosting provider of choice. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to setup your new project, and be sure to **add the same `.env.local` variables to your Vercel Project**

### Sanity
This is an easy one, you can simply run `sanity deploy` from the `/studio` folder in your project. Select a subdomain you want; your Studio is now accessible from the web. This is where I'll invite the client to manage the project so they can both add billing info and begin editing content.

### Client Updates
Once you hand off to the client you'll want to give them the ability to generate builds when they make updates within the Sanity Studio. The easiest way to do this is through my [Vercel Deploy plugin](https://github.com/ndimatteo/sanity-plugin-vercel-deploy).

# 🤘 Extras/Tips

<details>
<summary><strong>This looks like a theme... How can I use this like a starter?</strong></summary>

While this starter is relatively opinionated, the goal was three-fold:
1. Use high-quality packages that don't get in the way
2. Solve common UX problems and complex logic so you can focus on the fun stuff
3. Create a more approachable starter for anyone looking to build production-ready headless Shopify experiences

That being said, I understand this means a lot of what's included is **very opinionated**. However, you'll find that at it's core the structure and naming conventions lend itself to really making it your own. 

By now, I'm sure you noticed the ridiculous-looking [demo site](https://insane.codes/) (I love 90's metal, can you tell?)

I've purposefully extracted all the styles that pertain to the demo in a single CSS file (`/styles/_config/_666.css`). Remove it from your styles to truly strip it down to its _hull_.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's up with the CSS? What are extracted component classes and why should I use them?</strong></summary>

While utility-first CSS definitely speeds up your dev time, it can become overwhelming and untenable. This can make it difficult to understand what a component is doing when shrouded in dozens of utility classes, especially for developers getting familiar with a new codebase. Luckily, Tailwind offers the ability to [extract a component](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components), allowing you to compose custom utility patterns.

The nice thing about this is we can get all the benefits of writing in utility class shorthand, but without having to sift through all your javascript logic to adjust styles. This means writing our CSS is business as usual. You create stylesheets, but use Tailwind's `@apply` to create nice and succinct classes to push to your components.

You still get all the tree-shaking benefits of Tailwind, _and_ you can still use utility classes in your components when needed; the best of both worlds!
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this for non-Shopify projects?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! This starter was actually born out of a non-shopify starter I had been using for my own client projects. Simply delete the shopify-specific logic and you've got yourself a fancy static starter powered by Next and Sanity!

Here's a shortlist of what to remove:
- Within the `/components` folder, remove `cart`, `product`, and `shop` folders
- Within the `/pages/api` folder, remove `products` and `shopify` folders
- Within the `/pages` folder, remove `products` and `shop` folders
- Within the `_app.js` file, remove `<ShopifyContextProvider />` and `<Cart />` components
- Within the `/studio` folder, remove all shopify-related schemas, desk structures, and actions
- Within the `/components/header.js` file, remove references to shopify `context` and `cart`
- `/contexts` folder _(used for accessing shopify data anywhere)_
- `/lib/shopify.js` file _(shopify client setup)_
- `SHOPIFY_*` env variables from `next.config.js`
- `shopify-buy` dependency from `package.json`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: Failed to communicate with the Sanity API</strong></summary>

If you get this error in your CLI, you need to logout and log back in again. Simply do `sanity logout` and then `sanity login` to fix.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Access your "product_sync" metafields in Shopify without using a plugin</strong></summary>

Simply navigate directly to: `https://[store_id].myshopify.com/admin/bulk?resource_name=Product&edit=metafields.sanity.product_sync`

_(making sure to replace [store_id] with your Shopify Store ID)_
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I properly hand-off a Vercel project to the client?</strong></summary>

While not as easy as Netlify, what I prefer to do is:
1. Have the client create their own [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)
2. At the time of writing, Github connections can only be connected to one Vercel account at a time, so have the client [create a Github account](https://github.com/join) if they don't already have one, and transfer the project repo to them
3. Delete the dev project from your own Vercel account (this is so the client can utilize the project name and domain you were using during dev)
4. You or the client can now connect their newly transferred Github repo to their own Vercel account!
